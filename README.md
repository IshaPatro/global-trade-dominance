# Global Trade Dominance: U.S. vs. China (2000 vs 2024)

An interactive data visualization project that illustrates the dramatic shift in global trade dominance between the United States and China over a 24-year period (2000-2024). Built with Streamlit and Python, this application provides a compelling visual narrative of how global trade relationships have evolved over two decades.

## Project Overview

This Streamlit application visualizes how global trade relationships have evolved between 2000 and 2024, specifically focusing on the changing dynamics between the United States and China. The visualization shows:

- Interactive 3D rotating globes displaying trade dominance for both time periods
- Country-by-country breakdown of trade volumes with detailed data tables
- Comparative metrics showing the growth trajectories of both nations
- Visual representation of the number of countries where each nation is the dominant trade partner
- Dynamic filters and interactive elements for data exploration

## Key Findings

- In 2000, the United States was the undisputed global trade leader with approximately $1.88 trillion in trade volume, dominating trade relationships with the majority of countries worldwide.
- By 2024, China's trade volume grew exponentially to approximately $5.35 trillion, becoming the dominant trade partner for many countries previously aligned with the U.S.
- The U.S. trade volume also grew to approximately $4.75 trillion by 2024, but at a significantly slower pace than China.
- This visualization demonstrates not just economic growth, but a fundamental reconfiguration of global trade relationships.
